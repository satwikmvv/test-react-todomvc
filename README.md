## Implementation

Used ReactJS to update the Virtual DOM. Items are stored in the main app component state and are added through the SearchBar child component displayed using another child component called DisplayItems.

The manipulation of list items are done using setState and updated using array slice methods to not mutate the state.

Used conditional styling inside JSX for some of the components.
